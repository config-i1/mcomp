Forecasting Competitions Datasets.

This package provides access to historical time series forecasting competition
datasets (M1, M3, Tourism) with an interface similar to R's Mcomp package.

Usage
-----
>>> from fcompdata import M1, M3, Tourism
>>>
>>> # Access series by 1-based index (R-style)
>>> series = M3[1]
>>> print(series['x'])   # Training data
>>> print(series['xx'])  # Test data
>>> print(series['h'])   # Forecast horizon
>>>
>>> # Filter by type
>>> yearly = M3.subset('yearly')
>>> monthly = M1.subset('monthly')

Datasets
--------
M1 : MCompDataset
    M1 competition (1001 series)
M3 : MCompDataset
    M3 competition (3003 series)
Tourism : MCompDataset
    Tourism competition (1311 series)
